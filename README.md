# Node Spider for ClassRoom Courses

## Brief Intro

Spider for School Classrooms Courses

Mr.Boya used the world's best coding language to form the classroom course images last year while the parallel running caused the stuck up and overflow on the Dev Qsc and the whole process lasted for 10 hours

So I have to rewite it in node.js

Trying best to adjust the web page from school classroom register center 
Really awful experience for digging data and fixing forms (Especially in parsing string )
Those Unknown but long Validations are really really *** 
Well, Whatever....
Just let me set a flag here 
It will not be me again to rewrite or redig these database next year 
So 
Not that unsatisfied now

## Usage

! The website is only access available in ZJU school (DNS parse) networks

After`git clone`, please run `npm install` to pack all the dependencies

As for all the files: 

`config.js`: Set different seasons background image and set target dir to store images
`ClassRoom.js`: Store all the classroom needed to be traversed (Provided by the PMs)

Run `node app.js` to start forming classroom course images

The process will last 5 minutes or so

Well

Please Have Fun ~
